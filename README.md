# Learning React with Vite

This repository is part of my journey in learning React and improving my front-end development skills. I'm using Vite to set up my React projects for its fast performance and developer-friendly features.

## Tech Stack
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A next-generation front-end tool that provides fast HMR and optimized builds.
- **ESLint**: Helps maintain clean and consistent code.

## Why Vite?
Vite offers a super-fast development experience compared to traditional build tools. It provides:
- Lightning-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- Optimized production builds
- Support for modern JavaScript features

## Future Plans
I plan to expand this project by:
- Exploring advanced React concepts
- Integrating TypeScript for better type safety
- Experimenting with different state management solutions

Stay tuned for updates as I continue my learning journey! ðŸš€
